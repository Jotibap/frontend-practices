    <h1>Cold Coffee recipe</h1>
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    <h2>description</h2>
    <p>
      Cold coffee is a refreshing, creamy drink made by blending or mixing
      chilled milk with coffee, sugar, and ice. The simplest version starts by
      dissolving instant coffee and sugar in a little cold water, then mixing it
      with chilled milk and pouring it over ice. For a café-style taste, you can
      blend the coffee, milk, sugar, and ice together to create a smooth, frothy
      texture, or add a scoop of vanilla ice cream for extra richness. You can
      also customize it with chocolate syrup, caramel, or a hint of vanilla for
      added flavor. Cold coffee is quick to prepare, perfect for hot days, and
      can be made with regular milk or dairy-free alternatives like almond or
      oat milk.
