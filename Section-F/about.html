      <h2>About me</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      I’m Jotiba, an MCA graduate who has learned Java backend development with
      strong foundations in 
      <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>OOP</li>

      </ul>I’ve learned to build scalable applications using 
      <ul>
        <li>Spring Boot</li>
        <li>SQL with PostgreSQL</li>
      </ul>
      Through hands-on practice, I learned to optimize database queries and
      structure efficient backend systems. I’ve also learned frontend basics like

      <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
      </ul>
      to build complete web solutions. I
      learned to apply Hibernate/JPA for ORM and improve data handling. While
      learning cloud fundamentals, I explored deploying projects on platforms
      like Render, Railway, and Vercel. I’ve learned to follow clean code
      practices, debugging techniques, and end-to-end project development. My
      project work helped me learn real-world concepts like authentication,
      modular design, and performance tuning. I constantly learn new tools,
      thrive in structured planning, and enjoy building user-focused
      applications. Overall, I’ve learned to think like a developer who can
      solve problems across the full stack.
