    <h3>Description:</h3>
    The E-Visa Application is a digital system that replaces manual visa
    application processes with a smooth online workflow. It enables users to
    apply for visas, upload documents, track status, and receive alerts—all from
    home—removing the need for physical office visits.

    <h3>Key Features:</h3>
    Full Online Application Flow: Users can fill forms, upload documents, and
    submit applications digitally. <br /><br />
    Rule-Based ML Eligibility Engine: Implemented an automated check that
    analyzes user inputs, documents, and travel history to assess basic
    eligibility instantly.
    <br /><br />
    Admin Dashboard: Provided tools for officers to review applications, verify
    documents, and update status. Secure Data Handling: Ensured safe storage of
    user information and documents using secure APIs and backend validation.

    <h3>Technical Implementation:</h3>
    Developed using Java + Spring Boot for backend services. Implemented a
    rule-based machine learning module for eligibility checks. Used PostgreSQL
    for structured storage of applicant information, documents, and status
    records. Integrated REST APIs for submitting applications, eligibility
    evaluation, and status updates. Designed frontend using HTML, CSS,
    JavaScript to give a clean and responsive user interface.

    <h3>Impact:</h3>
    The system drastically reduces processing time by automating checks and
    digitizing approvals, making the visa process more transparent and
    accessible.
