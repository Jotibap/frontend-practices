          A Java Full Stack developer is a professional capable of handling both
          front-end and back-end development using Java-based technologies. On
          the front-end, they work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern
          frameworks to create user-friendly and responsive interfaces. On the
          back-end, they utilize Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and RESTful APIs
          to manage the core business logic, security, and communication between
          different parts of the application. They also work with relational
          databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL to store, retrieve, and manage
          data efficiently. A Java Full Stack developer understands the complete
          software development lifecycle, including design, development,
          testing, deployment, and maintenance. Their expertise allows them to
          develop scalable, secure, and high-performance applications that
          address real-world user needs. With strong problem-solving skills and
          the ability to work across multiple layers of an application, Java
          Full Stack developers play a crucial role in building modern,
          end-to-end web and enterprise solutions.
