        Bangalore - silicon city of India
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bengaluru, formerly known as Bangalore, is the capital and largest city
        of the southern Indian state of Karnataka. It is widely recognized as
        the "Silicon Valley of India" due to its leading role as the nation's
        information technology (IT) and startup hub.

      <p>
        Bengaluru, officially renamed from Bangalore, stands as the vibrant
        capital city of the southern Indian state of Karnataka and is globally
        recognized as the "Silicon Valley of India." This metropolis has rapidly
        evolved into the nation's undisputed leader in information technology,
        attracting multinational corporations, startups, and tech professionals
        from across the globe. Its economic engine drives significant growth not
        only in IT but also in aerospace, defense, and biotechnology, housing
        key organizations like the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and
        major tech firms such as Infosys and Wipro. Beyond its economic prowess,
        Bengaluru retains significant charm as the "Garden City," a moniker
        earned from its abundant green spaces, including the sprawling Lalbagh
        Botanical Garden and Cubbon Park, which provide residents a respite from
        the urban buzz. Situated on the Deccan Plateau at a high elevation, the
        city enjoys a year-round moderate and pleasant climate, a factor that
        historically made it a favored location for the British cantonment and
        continues to enhance its livability today. Culturally, Bengaluru is a
        dynamic melting pot. It boasts a cosmopolitan atmosphere, a thriving
        music scene (often dubbed the "Rock/Metal Capital"), a lively nightlife,
        and a diverse culinary landscape. The city is also a premier educational
        and research hub, home to elite institutions like the Indian Institute
        of Science (IISc). Landmarks such as the Tudor-style Bangalore Palace
        and the impressive Vidhana Soudha contrast with modern skyscrapers,
        embodying the city's unique blend of historical heritage and futuristic
        ambition. Despite challenges common to rapid urbanization, such as
        traffic congestion, Bengaluru remains a pivotal, energetic, and
        attractive center of innovation and life in India.
